# EDUCATIONAL COMMITTEE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
# Introduction
The project consists of studying, designing and creating a platform for managing the educational committees of departments within the University of Guelma. It allows, on the one hand, for the administration to effectively manage and control the members who play a role in carrying out various educational actions, setting meeting dates, sending invitations, etc. On the other hand, it allows the actors (course leaders, teachers, and students) to follow the educational activities within the department.
